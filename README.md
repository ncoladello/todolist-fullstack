ItÂ´s a ToDo List project, full-stack, using:

- Created a BackEnd API, to control entire application functions
- Docker to container the MySQL DB
- Framework Express.JS, using CORS tool to easily connect the BackEnd API to the FrontEnd
- A simple CSS, since the main intention of this project was the integration of an API with the FrontEnd
  -MMVC architecture
  -DB columns: id(int, PK), title(varchar), status(varchar), created_at(varchar)
